## Data Structure with TypeScript

the benefits of using the Type system from TypeScript is the ability to create new types alongside the class
definitions, which allows you to implement the Data Structure types easily and correctly.

I've tried to be as close as possible to the real use cases of Data Structures in Real life and
in the classic definitions.

## Examples

here's a quick type definition of Linked List.

```ts
type LinkedListType = {
  length: number;
  head: NodeType | null;
  tail: NodeType | null;
  push?(value: any): LinkedListType;
  pop?(): NodeType | unknown;
  shift?(): NodeType | unknown;
  unshift?(value: any): LinkedListType;
  get?(index: number): NodeType | unknown;
  set?(index: number, value: any): boolean;
  insert?(index: number, value: any): void;
  remove?(value: any): NodeType | unknown;
  reverse?(): void;
  log?(): void;
};
```

you can see that each property or method has a declared type. the `value` of a linked list however can be different, thats why `any` would make sense. A Generic type will be implemented soon.

### Run 

You can run the example and testing files with this command:


```bash
npm run examples
```

To compile the project, simply run:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Testing

Run tests with `npm test`.

Each Test file is related to one data structure(each file for subgroups)
the goal of the unit testing files is to assert the correctness of the implemented Data Structure. you can find tests in the [tests](./tests/) Directory.
